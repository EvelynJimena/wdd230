                <h2>Color Schema</h2>
                <p>Knowing that green, and white are part of our flag colors,
                   we thought we would take it to the next level by using 
                   colors like dartmouth green (266939)and Nyanza(DCF1D0).
                </p>
                <p>Dartmouth green, white and black will be used primarily in typography
                   Nyanza will be used in the background.
                </p>

                <h2>Typography</h2>
                <p>We believe that the site should be practical and understandable, 
                   that is why we have chosen to use the Merriweather font.
